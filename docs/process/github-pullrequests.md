# Contribution Chanage Management

![lifecycle](../_images/process/lifecycle.png)

We collaborate on the work of ToIP Foundation via [pull requests (`PRs`)](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) against the repository that is managing a specific deliverable.

## Pull Request Submissions

ToIP Deliverables may be managed in their own dedicated GitHub Repository or in the [trustoverip/deliverables](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables/) repo.

1. Fork the appropriate deliverables repo:

    * [Deliverables Repo](https://github.com/trustoverip/deliverables).
    * Dedicated Repository: `https://github.com/trustoverip/<repo_name>`, where `<repo_name>` is the name of the dedicated deliverable repository.

2. Each `PR` SHOULD be linked to an `Issue`.

## Pull Request Decisions
Standard GitHub processing is used.

* **`Closed`:** The `PR` was reviewed by the WG but it was decided to close it without merging it.
* **`Merged`:** The WG agreed to `merge` the `PR`.
