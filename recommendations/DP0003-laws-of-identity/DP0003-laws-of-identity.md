## Summary
The **Seven Laws of Identity** were [published by Kim Cameron, Architect of Identity at the Microsoft Corporation](https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf) in 2005. This document serves to recognize this work as a collection of design principles for identity solutions.  

## Motivation

We see our task for creating this document as defining practical scope Laws of Identity applications in all layers of the TOIP Technological Stack. Since Laws of Identity are very general, we understand the need to create a matrix where each Law of Identity will be looked from the perspective of every Layer of the Technology stack. By highlighting range of each and every Law of Identity we strive to help members of governance and ecosystem TFs with creating frameworks, policies, etc.

## Scope

This document serves to provide an opportunity to discuss how laws of identity **MUST** or **SHOULD**, or **MAY**  be applicable on every layer of TOIP Technology Stack.

In many standards track documents words **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are used to signify the requirements in the specification.  This matrix use these words according to IETF [RFC2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Trust Over IP Stack Layers Descriptions
The first two layers of the ToIP stack are designed to provide **technical trust** — the assurance that one machine can establish a secure, private connection with another machine. Layers Three and Four are where **human trust** is established and maintained.

**TL4:** **Application Ecosystem**. Layer Four is the application layer—the layer where humans interact with applications in order to engage in trusted interactions that serve a specific business, legal, or social purpose.

**TL3:** **Data Exchange Protocols**. Layer 3 is where issuers, holders, and verifiers exchange credentials and proofs using credential exchange protocols that run on top of DID Comm.

**TL2:** **DIDComm Peer to Peer Protocol**. Layer Two is about the branches—the digital wallets and digital agents needed to form secure, private peer-to-peer connections using either public DIDs (from Layer One) or peer DIDs.

**TL1:** **Public Utilities**. Layer One is about the strong cryptographic roots of technical trust. ToIP Layer One utilities can be implemented using any technology that can provide the necessary trust assurances, e.g., blockchains (of any kind), distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, distributed hash tables, and so on.

Briefly describe the scope of this document – how it presents the architecture of this particular enabler.  Include an explanation of how this architecture relates to Organization Name activity.  If it adds clarity, also describe what is not in the scope of this architecture.  DELETE THIS COMMENT

## Design Goals

We believe that matrix presentation will simplify the road to creation various governance frameworks, policies, requirements, etc. This matrix will provide easily consumable format of relationship between Laws of Identity and TOIP Technological Stack Layers.

### 1. User Control and Consent
Digital identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user's consent.
| **MUST** | **SHOULD** | **MAY** | **NOT Applicable** ||
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---:|
||||| TL4 |
||||| TL3 |
||||| TL2 |
||||| TL1 |
### 2. Limited Disclosure for Limited Use
The solution which discloses the least identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable, long-term solution.
| **MUST** | **SHOULD** | **MAY** | **NOT Applicable** ||
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---:|
||||| TL4 |
||||| TL3 |
||||| TL2 |
||||| TL1 |
### 3. The Law of Fewest Parties
Digital identity systems must limit disclosure of identifying information to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship.
| **MUST** | **SHOULD** | **MAY** | **NOT Applicable** ||
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---:|
||||| TL4 |
||||| TL3 |
||||| TL2 |
||||| TL1 |
### 4. Directed Identity
A universal identity metasystem must support both "omnidirectional" identifiers for use by public entities and "unidirectional" identifiers for private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles.
| **MUST** | **SHOULD** | **MAY** | **NOT Applicable** ||
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---:|
||||| TL4 |
||||| TL3 |
||||| TL2 |
||||| TL1 |
### 5. Pluralism of Operators and Technologies
A universal identity metasystem must channel and enable the interworking of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers.
| **MUST** | **SHOULD** | **MAY** | **NOT Applicable** ||
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---:|
||||| TL4 |
||||| TL3 |
||||| TL2 |
||||| TL1 |
### 6. Human Integration
A unifying identity metasystem must define the human user as a component integrated through protected and unambiguous human-machine communications.
| **MUST** | **SHOULD** | **MAY** | **NOT Applicable** ||
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---:|
||||| TL4 |
||||| TL3 |
||||| TL2 |
||||| TL1 |
### 7. Consistent Experience Across Contexts
A unifying identity metasystem must provide a simple consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.
| **MUST** | **SHOULD** | **MAY** | **NOT Applicable** ||

## Synopsis
Please refer to the [original article](http://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.html) by the author for a complete synopsis about each principle.

## Relevance

```
Explain the positioning of each principle against the overarching goals of this proposal.  How / where would they be used (example Use cases or industry sectors).

```

## Trade-offs
It's clear that creating any matrix will always result in border situation when there is no clear choice between **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY**. This shouldn't stop us from thinking about situation when there is a clear answer and therefore a direct relation between Laws of Identity and TOIP Technological Stack Layers.
We also understand that by creating such a matrix we might shift focus from overall fundamental picture to more detailed way of looking on governance and ecosystem frameworks.

Provide an assessment of the ramifications of including and/or excluding each principle in a solution.
