## Summary

The objective of this best practice document is to provide guidance on how to assess the sustainability of an existing [Public Identity Utility](link to glossary term) (PUI). For the purpose of this Best Practice document, we will solely focus on blockchain-based public identity utilities.

## Motivation

### Why are we doing this?

This document is being written as a [result of multiple interviews](https://github.com/trustoverip/utility-foundry-wg/tree/master/workflow/stories) that were conducted with utility project conveners in October 2020. We spoke with conveners and participants of these following PIUs.

A common theme that came across the discussions was related to the sustainability of a PIU, more specifically how a particular PIU will help deploy a business model that will ensure long-term operational success.

Assessing sustainability should be considered as a core due diligence activity when evaluating a PIU.

### What are the expected outcomes?

We hope this Best Practice document will serve as a tool among others to help:

(a) Organizations/Ecosystems who want to evaluate an existing public identity utility using a framework to project the highest ROI and minimized risks.

(b) Organizations/Ecosystems interested in convening a new public identity utility to have a framework to evaluate what is out there today and what market gap their utility can fill.


## Scope

```
Briefly describe the scope of this document – how it presents the architecture of this particular enabler.  Include an explanation of how this architecture relates to Organization Name activity.  If it adds clarity, also describe what is not in the scope of this architecture.  DELETE THIS COMMENT

## Best Practices

### Lesson 1: Assess business sustainability

* How well funded are they?
* What is their burn rate?
* What is their revenue model?
* What are their financial projections?
* What are their customer acquisition or growth projections?
* What are their accounts receivables?
* Are they profitable today or not?
* Does the public identity utility offer other services?  How do they charge for services?
* How does the public identity utility charge their members?


### Lesson 2: Assess legal sustainability

* What type of corporation are they?
* Where is the location of the corporation?
* What is the corporate governance structure?
* Who are the directors of the organization?
* Who are the beneficial owners of the organization?


### Lesson 3: Assess technology sustainability

* Are the PIU’s technologies standards-based?
* Are the technologies used in the PIU based on open source technologies or open source projects?
* If it is not open source, who is supporting and contributing to the repositories?
* What contracts does the PIU have with technology providers? Do they have long term contracts or short term contracts?

### Lesson 4: Assess social sustainability

The goal of a sustainable business strategy is to make a positive impact on either one of those areas. When companies fail to assume responsibility, the opposite can happen, leading to issues like environmental degradation, inequality, and social injustice.

* Is the PIU going to grow long-term based on how accessible they make it to people?
* Will the PIU be sustainable long-term based on how they are dealing with inclusivity? (the whole concept of identity for all)
* How is the PIU dealing with privacy?
* How is the PIU making supply chain decisions? Are they contracting work to poor countries for cheap labor in unethical conditions?
* What effect does the PIU have on the environment?
* How much waste is the organization creating?
* Is the organization culture struggling?
* Are the PIU hiring practices attracting diverse job candidates?
* Are the PIU products targeted to help a certain audience?
* What impact does the PIU have on the local community?


### Lesson 5: Assess governance sustainability

* Who are the different parties or organizations involved in decision-making?
* Who are the individuals that have influential roles or decision-making roles?
* How is the actual network governed regarding such things like updating the network, running consensus on transactions and adding parties to the network?
* How is the performance of the network being governed and managed, and how is that information being made transparent?
* Is the PIU publishing their governance structure openly?
* What is the policy for publishing any issues/findings with the network?
* How are they proactively fixing defects?
